$counter = 1  # Start a counter for the serial numbers

Get-ChildItem -Path . -File | ForEach-Object {
    # Generate a random prefix using a GUID
    $prefix = [guid]::NewGuid().ToString().Substring(0, 6)

    # Construct the new filename with the random prefix and serial number
    $newName = "$prefix" + "_" + "$counter" + $_.Extension

    # Rename the file
    Rename-Item -Path $_.FullName -NewName $newName

    # Increment the counter for the next file
    $counter++
}

Explanation:

Current Directory: By using Get-ChildItem -Path . -File, it will fetch all files in the current folder where you execute the script.

Random Prefix and Counter: Similar to the previous script, it generates a random 6-character prefix and appends a serial number.


Usage:

1. Open PowerShell in the folder containing your files (Shift + Right-click in the folder, then choose "Open PowerShell window here").


2. Run the script directly in PowerShell.



This script will rename each file in the folder with a format like randomprefix_1.extension, randomprefix_2.extension, etc.
